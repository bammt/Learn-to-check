Since David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, David did p + 29 push-ups.

This is necessary to answer the question, so the goal is reasonable.\nFrom the question, we know that 406 people visited the palace in total and 132 visited today.

To find this, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the total number of visitors. So, 274 - (327 x 1) = 274 - 327 = -53. This calculation is incorrect because it assumes that all 274 visitors visited within the past 327 days, which is not necessarily true.\nStep 3: The correct approach is to divide the total number of visitors by the number of days and then multiply by the number of days since the last visit to find the number of visitors on the previous day. For example, if there were 406 visitors over 327 days, then on any given day, there would be 406 / 327 = 1.25 visitors per day. Subtracting 1 from this gives us the number of visitors on the previous day. So, on the previous day, there were 1.25 - 1 = 0.25 visitors. Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we have 0 visitors on the previous day.\nAnswer: 0"}
