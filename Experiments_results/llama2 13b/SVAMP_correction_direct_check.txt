Therefore, we need to find a way to adjust the numbers until they match.\nOne possible solution is to distribute the excess candies among the bags. Since there are 26 bags and each candy was distributed equally among them, each bag would receive 26 / 15 = 1.73 candies on average. However, since we cannot have fractional amounts of candies or cookies, we round down to the nearest whole number. Each bag would therefore receive 1 candy.\nSimilarly, we can distribute the remaining 52 - 15 = 37 cookies among the bags. Again, since there are 26 bags and each cookie was distributed equally among them, each bag would receive 26 / 37 = 0.73 cookies on average.
