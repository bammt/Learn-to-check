Then, the amount of money she spent is x + 33 - 78 = -45. This means that Olivia must have had negative 45 dollars before spending any money. However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, it is clear that this solution is not possible. Therefore, we need to find another approach.\nStep 2: Since Olivia spent $78 and had $33 left afterward, we know that the total amount of money she spent is $78 + $33 = $111. So, we can set up the equation x + $111 = $78. Solving for x, we subtract $111 from both sides: x = $78 - $111 = -$33. Again, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this solution is also invalid.\nTherefore, we cannot determine how much money Olivia had initially without further information. It could be anything between $-99 and $33 (or even outside these ranges)."}

Therefore, the average number of points he scores per round is 84 / 2 = 42 points.\nAnswer: 42"}
{"question": "Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?", "answer": "( 353.0 - 22.0 )=331.0", "output1": " Step 1: The feathers need 353 - 22 = <<353-22=331>>331g of wax.\nStep 2: Thus, he has 331/57 = <<331/57=5.86>>5.86g of wax so far.\nanswer: 5", "cnt_step": 2, "output2": "Step 2 is wrong.", "output3": "Step 1: The feathers need 353 - 22 = 331 g of wax.\nStep 2: Since each gram of color requires 57 g of wax, the amount of wax needed for the colors is 57 x 57 = 3095 g.\nStep 3: Therefore, he already has 3095 - 331 = 2764 g of wax.\nAnswer: 2764"}
{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?", "answer": "( 36.0 / 12.0 )=3.0", "output1": " Step 1: The number of seeds that grew into flowers is equal to the total number of seeds planted, so we know this equation must be true: 58 = 12s + s, where \"s\" represents the number of seeds planted.\nStep 2: Subtracting 58 from both sides gives us 46 = 12s, which means 46/12 equals s (the number of seeds planted).\nStep 3: Dividing both sides by 4 gives us s as approximately 3.92.\nStep 4: Since there were 36 seeds planted and 3.92 represent the number of seeds planted per flowerbed, then Paige's mother had .92 or 92% of the flower beds filled with flowers. This would mean she has at least 3 * 0.92 = <<3*0.92=2.76>>2.76 full flower beds.\nanswer: 2", "cnt_step": 4, "output2": "Step 3 is wrong.", "output3": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of seeds planted as \"x\". According to the problem, x = 36 - 58 = -22. Therefore, there were not enough seeds for all the flower beds, since a negative value cannot represent the number of seeds planted.\nStep 2: We conclude that Paige's mother had no flower beds."}
{"question": "At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?", "answer": "( 75.0 - 19.0 )=56.0", "output1": " Step 1: The total number of reptiles in the cage is 3+75 = <<3+75=78>>78\nStep 2: There are 82 + 19 = <<82+19=101>>101 alligators and snakes at the zoo.\nStep 3: So there are 101-78 = <<101-78=23>>23 alligators that aren't hidden.\nanswer: 23", "cnt_step": 3, "output2": "Step 2 is wrong.", "output3": "Step 1: The total number of reptiles in the cage is 3 + 75 = 78 (snakes plus alligators).\nStep 2: There are 82 snakes + 19 alligators = 101 reptiles at the zoo.\nStep 3: So there are 101 - 78 = 23 alligators that aren't hidden.\nAnswer: 23"}
{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?", "answer": "( 60.0 * ( 55.0 / 15.0 ) )=220.0", "output1": " Step 1: First find how many flower beds there were: 55 total seeds / 15 seeds per bed = <<55/15=3.7>>3.7 flower beds\nStep 2: Then multiply that number by the number of plants that grew to find the total number of flowers: 3.7 flower beds * 60 seeds/bed = <<3.7*60=222>>222 flowers\nanswer: 222", "cnt_step": 2, "output2": "The answer is all correct."}
