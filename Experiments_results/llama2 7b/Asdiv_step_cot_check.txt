Let's use the inverse operation to check the solution: If we set up the equation (154 - 11x) / 11 = r and multiply both sides by 11, we get 154 - 11x = 11r. Simplifying further, we get 154 - 11x = 11r. Now let's subtract 11x from both sides: 154 - 11x = 11r - 11x. This simplifies to 154 - x = r. Since x represents the number of rounds played, this means the equation becomes 154 - x = r. The general solution to this equation would be 154 - x = r, with solutions being x = r or x = 154. However, since x cannot take on negative values, the only valid solution here is x = r. In other words, the number of rounds played is equal to the right-hand side of the equation, which is r. So, the final answer is r = 11."}
