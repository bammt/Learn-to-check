Let's denote that as C(x). The total cost for purchasing these new books becomes C(X), which we know equals the sum of all costs.\n   C(x) = 30*x + 4*(21*x)\n   C(x) = 30*x + 84*x\n   C(x) = 114*x\n   96*x < 114*x\n   96*x > 114*x\n   Since 96*x represents the value before selling any books, then after selling 21 books, it must be greater than or equal to the value representing the number of books purchased with the proceeds. Therefore, the value represented by 114*x must also represent the number of books purchased, so 114*x = 30. Solving for x gives us x = 30/114.\nStep 3: Substituting the value of x back into the equation, we find that the original question asks about the number of books Roger has after buying 30 new ones using the money he made from selling 21 other books. So the final number of books remains 4, since that was the initial quantity remaining after selling 21 books.\nAnswer: 4"}
