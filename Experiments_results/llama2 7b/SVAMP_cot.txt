{"prompt": "Human: \nEvery day Ryan spends 2 hours on learning english, 5 hours on learning chinese and 4 hours on learning spanish. How many more hours does he spend on learning chinese than he does on learning spanish?\n\nAssistant: \n", "generated_text": " Let's say the number of hours spent on each language is x for English, y for Chinese and z for Spanish. We know that x+y+z=6 because we are told that everyday Ryan spends 2+5+4 = <<2+5+4=11>>11 hours in total studying languages.\nWe also know that x>0 because if it was equal to zero then there would be no point in him taking time out of his day to learn a new language at all.\nSimilarly, since both y and z > 0 as well, this means that either (x-y) or (x-z) must be positive numbers.\nSince these two quantities represent the difference between the amount of time Ryan spends on one language compared with another, they cannot both be negative so therefore only one quantity can be greater than the other by how much.\nTherefore, let us first find what value(s) satisfy the equation x-y=a where a represents any real number. To do this, we perform the following steps:\n First subtract y from x which gives x-y=(x-y)=x-y\nThen multiply both sides of the equation by -1 which gives -(x-y)=-(x-y)=-x+y\nNow add x to both sides of the equation which gives -x=-x+y+x\nFinally, combine like terms to give -y=-y+x\nThis shows that when the values of x and y are substituted into the original equation, the resulting expression will always evaluate to -y. Therefore, the value of a representing the difference between the amounts of time Ryan spends on one language compared with another is -y.\nSo now we have found that the value of a is -y, we need to determine its sign. Since a represents the difference between the amount of time Ryan spends on one language compared with another, this means that if a has a positive value (-y), then x-y must be a larger quantity than y-z. This means that x-y>y-z.\nIf a has a negative value (-y), then x-y<y-z.\nIn either case, this means that x-y>y-z.\n#### 3"}
