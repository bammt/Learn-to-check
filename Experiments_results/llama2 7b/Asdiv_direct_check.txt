{"question": "at the zoo a cage had 3.0 snakes and 75.0 alligators . if 82.0 snakes and 19.0 alligators were hiding how many alligators were not hiding ?", "answer": 56.0, "output1": " Step 1: The total number of animals in the cage was 3+75 = <<3+75=78>>78 animals.\nStep 2: There is no information on which type of animal was missing so we don't know if it is more likely to be snake or alligator. If there are two snakes then there must have been at least one alligator but we do not know how many snakes there originally were so this approach will only work with large numbers of each animal. We therefore need to find another method that takes account of the smaller possible size of either population.\nStep 3: Since the original number of snakes could take any value from 1 upwards, I am going to use a range instead of a definite value because I cannot assume what it initially might have been (the method assumes equal populations). In the same way, since both types of animal start off as equally populated, this means their difference should also remain constant, i.e. Alligators-Snakes = 82 - 3 = <<82-3=79>>79 alligators. This means they were reduced by exactly half of their initial count, which would be 19/2 =<<19/2=9.5>>9.5 alligators out of a total of 79 who chose to hide away. They therefore represent 9.5 / 79 * 100% = 12% of the entire population who hid. Now, I want to establish how much these changes reduce the total population, given its known makeup before we began...\nStep 4: At first sight, you might think that losing three snakes out of thirty represents one third of them, which is obviously wrong when considering just 82 / 3 = <<82/3=27>>27 remained showing themselves. It would actually mean that over a quarter of them decided to hide themselves, which is clearly impossible. To determine the actual proportion correctly we need to multiply those values by 3 because there were originally three kinds of animal involved, so now our equation becomes 82*3 = 78*. Using rounding again here gives us 78/.333 = <<82*3=260>>260 kindred spirits remaining visible, which means a reduction in their numbers from 78 down to 260 leaves us with an unseen contingent representing 78 - 260 = <<78-260=182>>182 individuals choosing to remain hidden. Now, finally knowing this quantity (or at least having some idea) lets us apply it back into my previous calculation using that proportion to figure out how many did not choose to stay inside. For every group of friends represented by someone who came forward, then three times as many got scared stiff and fled the scene of the crime so 9.5 people disappearing makes for approximately 28 more of the same vanishing act in disguise (since three times 9.5 equals around 28, give or take, due to rounding issues). That accounts for the full number of alligators who stayed concealed while adding this information together completes the problem, 28 kindred spirits joining the ranks of the unknown for every 9.5 who put themselves front and centre (28 + 9.5 = <<28+9.5=37>>37 of the 79 that made themselves scarce), meaning a total of 79 such creatures who decided to go AWOL minus the 12 that went MIA means there were 79-12-37 = 30 non hiding alligators in all. answer: 30", "cnt_step": 3, "output2": "Step 3 is wrong.", "pred_wrong_step": 3, "output3": "Step 1: The total number of animals in the cage is 3 + 75 = 78 animals.\nStep 2: Let's assume the original number of snakes was x. Since there were 82 snakes added later, we can set up the equation x + 82 = 82. Solving this equation, we find that x = 82. Therefore, there were 3 original snakes.\nStep 3: Similarly, let's assume the original number of alligators was y. Since there were 19 alligators added later, we can set up the equation y + 19 = 75. Solving this equation, we find that y = 75. Therefore, there were 75 original alligators.\nStep 4: The number of alligators that chose to hide is 19. So, the number of alligators that didn't choose to hide is 75 - 19 = 56.\nanswer: 56"}

This gives us (3/4)*.5=3/4 of a cake consumed meaning you need to find out how much one eight-fraction is worth before dividing it again, but in base ten it comes to three tenths so...\nStep 4: Three tenths divided between four people works out to be a twelfth of a cake for each person, which rounds down to zero because there aren't any decimals left over after finding fractions of fractions, meaning no one ate a single cake\nanswer: 0", "cnt_step": 4, "output2": "Step 1 is wrong.", "pred_wrong_step": 1, "output3": "Step 1: Let's assume the initial number of crackers is x and the initial number of cakes is y. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, the ratio of crackers to cakes is x:y.\nStep 2: The total number of crackers and cakes is given as 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the sum of the numerators and denominators of the ratio is x + y + 1 + 1 = 6. Solving for x and y, we get x + y = 18 - 6 = 12.\nStep 3: Now let's assign values to x and y. We know that x + y = 12, so x + 8 = 12. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get x = 4. Similarly, we also know that y + 10 = 12, so y = 12 - 10 = 2.\nStep 4: Finally, we divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the total number of friends to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate. There are 4 friends, so each person ate (x + y)/4 = (4 + 2)/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 cakes.\nAnswer: Each person ate 1.5 cakes."}

This means that we need to find the difference between Melissa's scores across all her wins/losses to figure out how many wins there were in total because this will give us the number of times she got 12.0 points which indicates winning a match. If Melissa gets -4 against her opponent then she must have gained 5 as it equals -4+5 = <<-4+5=9>>9 points or some other sum where 9 represents a win on the board. So let's say she had X number of such matches throughout her entire competition (not just during one round). Therefore 3*X=87 because 3 * Number Of Wins = Total Score Achieved In All Winning Matches And We Know That One Win Is Corresponded With An Addition Of Nine Points So Three Wins Will Result To Adding Up Thirty nine Points Across The Entire Set Of Competitions Played Which Comes Out As Being Eighty Seven When Added Together... Hence proving She Had 3 Games.\nStep 2: Let x be the number of games Melissa played. Since every game has one winner and two losers, each player earns a score of either −1 or +1 depending on whether they won or lost their respective matchups (for example, see above where Melissa earned 9 points from a victory over her opponent).

{"question": "david did 44.0 push-ups in gym class today . david did 9.0 more push-ups than zachary . how many push-ups did zachary do ?", "answer": 35.0, "output1": " Step 1: If David did 44 push-ups and 9 more then Zachary did, it means he also did one less as well since you cannot have exactly equal amounts of something added to or taken away from another number, if we say 5 apples were given to me but my friend had one less I would not have received four because we don't give fractions so there has to be a minimum amount of five minus one which is four. This goes both ways therefore when you add nine push ups more than someone else who was already doing zero, there must have been three people present at this time performing these exercises where everyone subtracted their push up counts equally like this 33+27=? (this equals fifty) this shows the numbers need to equate each other out perfectly otherwise no equation could solve for what ever number that doesn't fit into the puzzle\nStep 2: Since David did 44 push-ups and 9 more than Zachary, Zachary = 44 - 9 = <<44-9=35>>35 push-ups.\nanswer: 35", "cnt_step": 2, "output2": "Step 1 is wrong.", "pred_wrong_step": 1, "output3": "Step 1: Let's assume the number of push-ups Zachary did is x. According to the information given, David did 44 push-ups and 9 more than Zachary, so David did 44 + 9 = 53 push-ups.\nSince David and Zachary did the same exercise, they should have the same number of push-ups. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 9 = 53\nSolving the equation, we find that x = 44.\nAnswer: Zachary did 44 push-ups."}

This is where we add 4 to every term because 2 * ((rx)+x) = (2r +2)(x+4)\nStep 4: Distributing the second parenthesis in this equation gets us (2r+2)*5, which equals 10 for the entire thing. So now the terms break down into 2r + 2 as well as a constant factor of 5 added onto both sides of the equation: 10=(2r+2),(5r+5), meaning that the total comes out to 6 because adding like terms produces common denominators. Thus, 6=5r+5, because 6-9=-3. We have found that when 5r=3, then we will take 6/5=1.2 which means r=<<1.2=.8>>.8 because .8*.5=<<.8*.5=.4>>.4 and thusly .4=x because x/.4=2.

{"question": "jesse needs a carpet of size 10.0 square feet to cover her room . if her room is 2.0 feet wide what is the length of her room ?", "answer": 5.0, "output1": " Step 1: We know how many square footage she wants and we know one side of the area so all we have left is figuring out the width which will give us Length = sq ft / (length*width) * width or ln(sqft/w)=ln((length*width)/sqft)*length^2=2*l where l represents the length\nStep 2: Knowing that, knowing that both sides must be equal we take the natural log on both sides giving us the equation : sqft/w= (length*width)/sqrt[2]\nStep 3: If I then divide this into its parts taking the w in terms of sq ft , length*width & sqrt [2], we get sqft/(length*width) = (length*width)/sqrt[2])\nStep 4: Multiplying through the parentheses gives me 2*SqFt/(length*width)) = (length*width)/root2)\nStep 5: Then dividing through those we get SqFt/ (length*height) = root2*(length*width) / (2*length^2)\nStep 6: Distributing gives me 2*squarefroot[(sqFt)(length*width)] = sqFt/4*length*width\nStep 7: Taking half-square roots of each term individually since they're like squared numbers now, and converting them back to decimal form we find (square root of (4*length*width))) = sqrt [(4*length*width)](length/2)^2\nStep 8: Since there are two things raised to their second power here you would assume the value was greater than 1, so just divide everything by it after raising it to the first power. So we get ((length*2)^2)/(4*length*width) = 1\nStep 9: If you distribute this inside the parenthesis you get (length^2)/(4*length*width) = 1 and therefore the new length = 4*length*width/length^2\nStep 10: If I take the square root from the right hand side, we are finding the square root of (4*length*width), but also noticing that at least once side has to stay the same because the floor area is given as 10, meaning when we figure out the new length we need to make sure it still has a width of 2. To keep that ratio intact the length will change while the width remains constant. This means our new length should remain 2 and the width increase. With that being said, multiplying the old width times four I arrive at 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 feet wide.\nStep 11: Now with the information we know thus far - the area needed equals 10 sq ft., Jesse wanted a width of 2 feet and the new length was calculated at 8 feet long... We multiply these three quantities together (length*width*area) to see exactly how much space the whole thing takes up and getting 8*2*10 = <<8*2*10=160>>160 sq ft.\nanswer: 8", "cnt_step": 11, "output2": "Step 1 is wrong.", "pred_wrong_step": 1, "output3": "Step 1: Let's assume the length of the room is x.

Since there were 41 bird families initially, the total number of bird families near the mountain is 41 + x.\nStep 2: We know that the total number of bird families near the mountain after migration is 27, so we can set up the equation: 41 + x = 27. Solving for x, we find that x = 27 - 41 = -14.\nStep 3: However, since we cannot have negative numbers of bird families, we subtract 41 from both sides of the equation: -14 = -41 + 41. This simplifies to 0 = 82, which is not possible. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of bird families that were left near the mountain.\nAnswer: It is impossible to determine the exact number of bird families that were left near the mountain."}

So the overall number of kids she played with is 12 + 14 = 26.\nStep 2: To find the total number of hours Julia spent playing tag, we need to convert the number of hours (34) from decimal form to fractional form. Since there are 24 hours in one day, we divide 34 / 24 = 1-1/24 or approximately 1/24. Therefore, for every hour that passes, Julia plays tag with 1/24th of all the kids she has ever played with.\nStep 3: Since Julia played tag with 26 kids in total, she spends 1/24 * 26 = 1/24 * 7 = 1/14 of an hour per kid. This means that for each individual kid, Julia spends 1/14 of an hour playing tag with them.\nAnswer: She played with a total of 26 kids for a combined time of 1/14 of an hour per kid, so the total time spent playing tag is 26 x 1/14 = 18/14 = 12/7 = 2 hours."}
