This means we cannot assume any kind of equal spending throughout all goods. Thus, the cost per item must be determined first before considering how many items there were.\nStep 2: Let's consider one single item which was bought as an example to find out its price: $78 - 33 =$<<78-33=45>>45 remained after buying just this one thing\nStep 3: Thus, each purchased good had been worth $78 / 45 = $<<78/45=1.76>>1.76\nStep 4: Since there must have been more than just these few goods sold individually, let's multiply the value found above by the number of such things: We get $1.76 * n = $78\nStep 5: Thus, if we now divide both sides of the equation by 1.76, then the initial sum of money will become apparent: $78 / (1.76) = <<78/(1.76)=45>>45\nanswer: 45", "cnt_step": 5, "output2": ["Step 1 is wrong.", "Step 2 is wrong for other reasons described below;", "Step 3 is wrong.", "Step 4 could work for two different cases only depending upon whether or noon \"n\" equals zero because when multiplied through the result would always return twenty seven regardless either way so answer b", "Step 5 is wrong ."], "pred_wrong_step": 1, "output3": "Step 1: The amount of money Olivia spent is given as $78.

Since only 12 new children joined, the additional children who got off the bus and whose numbers now total up to 68 must be equal to x, which means they also increased to 68 when x increases. This implies there are as much as x more people that got off the bus than those that joined it. So if we let X represent this number then 92-x –x = 68 and since subtraction gives minus, the expression becomes 92–2*x = 68 from which we get 2 *x =17 so that the extra number of children that got off exceeds that which boarded by 17 children. We therefore set out to find what value of x represents this 17 in the equation thus x = 17/2 Children\nanswer: 9", "cnt_step": 3, "output2": ["Step 1 is wrong.", "Step 2 is wrong.", "Step 3 wrong!"], "pred_wrong_step": 1, "output3": "Step 1: Before 68 children got off, there was a total of 36 + 68 = 104 children in the bus.\nStep 2: After some children got on the bus, the new total became 104 + (68 - 12) = 104 + 56 = 160 children.\nStep 3: The difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on is 68 - 12 = 56.
