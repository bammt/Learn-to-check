After buying more books, Paul has y - x books left. Since he sold (27 + x) books, we have (y - x) - x = 27. This simplifies to y - x = 17. Therefore, the initial number of books was y = 17 + x.\nStep 3: Solving for x, we find that x = (17 + x)/(17 - x). Dividing both sides by (17 - x), we get 1/(17 - x) = 1/((17 + x)/(17 - x)) = 1/((17 + x)*(17 - x)) = 1/28 = 0.0368. Multiplying both sides by 28 gives us x = 368.\nStep 4: Now let's substitute this value into the equation from Step 2: (17 + 368)/(17 - 368) = 17. Subtracting 368 from both sides, we get 17 - 368 = 17*(17 - 368) = 17 * 195 = 3229. Adding 368 back to both sides, we get 3229 + 368 = 3597. Therefore, Paul sold 3597 books.\nAnswer: 3597"}
